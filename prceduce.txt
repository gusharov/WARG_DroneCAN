start reading dsdl files line by line, if its a variable bit length object, the first byte will define the length, if its the last line, then it can have tao, for now assume no tao, objects just map in order of data byte to dsdl file, the first 7 bytes are useful data and the last is a check that says it was the end of transfer, look into ways of checking for that in a message that is shorter than 8 bytes, you can do this!!!!
